ASUS G20aj desktop LED lighting manipulation in Python

By WIlliam Herrera, September 2015

To install python for those without it: download 64-bit Anaconda Python at https://www.continuum.io/downloads (the 2.7 version, NOT 3.4) and the pyaudio package at https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/packages/pyaudio-0.2.8.py27.exe

Or, you might be able to run the py2exe compilations without python (may or may not work on your system) at http://www.alahonua.com/temp/asus_light_clock.zip 

Remember to run all these scripts as an administrator, since this is usually required by Windows to allow changes in hardware settings such as lighting.
